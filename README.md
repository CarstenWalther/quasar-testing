# **`@quasar/testing`** - *Work in Progress*
This is the monorepo for integrating the test-runner of your choice into your Quasar-Framework app v0.16 and above. 


The current backend sprint is regarding the creation of the [MVP unit-test](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-test/projects/1)

The current front-end sprint is regarding the creation of the [MVP storybook-docs](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-test/projects/2)

For more information and current status, please refer to the following RFC's:

- [\[RFC\] Add --mode test to quasar-cli](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli/issues/127)
- [\[RFC\] Add test runners to project during quasar init](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-starter-kit/issues/43)

## Contents

The packages in this repo are designed to be installed only by the Quasar framework. They follow the following naming convention: 

 - @quasar/testing
 - @quasar/testing-base
 - @quasar/testing-hud
 - @quasar/testing-unit-* 
 - @quasar/testing-e2e-* 
 - @quasar/testing-quality-*
 - @quasar/testing-utils-*

Where for example the `ava` test-runner would be `@quasar/test-unit-ava`. 



> Although you could probably install them all with yarn, it is highly recommended to follow the normal approach of using the quasar CLI.  If you are interested in breaking the warranty, if you were only interested in integrating ava and spectron into your app, technically you could merely run: 

```bash
$ yarn add @quasar/test-base 
$ yarn add @quasar/test-unit-ava
$ yarn add @quasar/test-e2e-spectron
```

## Development 
The recommended stable way to install this module is in concert with latest dev branches of quasar-cli and quasar-framework.

There is a microrepo that can help your scaffolding.
